# **The Lifespan of a Kpop Group** #

The data used for this repository was obtained through Kaggle [thanks to dbkpop](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mpwolke/kpop-idols-boy-groups/data) and is used for my Code Kentucky data analysis project for July 2022.

I will be creating a project to analyze data on kpop boy groups, specifically to determine how many groups make it past the so-called "seven year curse" in their original formation. It's common practice in the industry for kpop artists, more commonly known as "idols," to sign contracts for a period of seven years once they are set to debut as a group. However, by the time those seven years are up, many groups experience changes within their ranks; it could be member losses, a total disbandment, or an indefinite hiatus. I want to examine for often these changes occur.

This is a project that is meant to help me begin my journey to learning Python and is my submission for the final project in my Code Kentucky data analysis 1 course.

# **Project Plan** #

Features to be included:

* Feature 1: Read in data from a local csv that I obtained from Kaggle.
* Feature 2: I will clean data by removing null values and by removing unneeded sections of data. For example, my dataset includes the names of the groups in both English and in Korean. I don't think the Hangul characters are necessary for this project as the groups are often known by the English versions of their names internationall. Additionally, the fan club names are not necessary for this project either and will also be removed to clean up my data.
* Feature 3: I intended to analyze my data by using Pandas calcualations such as finding the mean, median, and mode of the debut dates and original members columns, using a string operation to find out which company has debuted the most groups over the years, dividing the original members column by the current members column, and other features to be determined.
* Feature 4: I will visualize my data using matplotlib. For example, I would like to do a scatterplot of groups per company.
* Feature 5: I will write markdown cells in Jupyter explain my thought process and code.
